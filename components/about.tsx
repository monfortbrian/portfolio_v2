        Iâ€™ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my

        <span className="underline ">8 years old</span>, just months after my

        <span className="font-medium">tech startups owner</span>. I love working
        with UX and my main focus is how to better improve the experience for
        different kinds of people. I love working with Javascript
        ecosystem/Jamstack tech and, on occasion, creating new designs (when
        time allows). My real strength, though, is figuring out better ways and
        bridging gaps teams, customers, and everyone else. I'm a methodical,
        logical thinker and I'm constantly looking for force multiplier
        opportunities to help others provide their best results too. I'm
        passionate about creating a better environment for everyone, and
        creating <span className="font-medium">Bluetec</span> is a continuation
        of that goal.
